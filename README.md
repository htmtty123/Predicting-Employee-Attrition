# Predicting Employee Attrition at IBM 

Attrition is a major problem for all businesses regardless of location, size and industry sector.
A well-managed human resources department is critical to any organization. Companies
spend a lot of time and money to nurture their most valuable asset: their employees. When
employees leave, companies face huge losses. High turnover means high cost. Hence, it is
important to be able to predict turnover rate. The Human Resources Department would greatly
benefit from the ability of Data Scientists to predict employee attrition risk and identify the
underlying factors contributing to it, such as inadequate compensation, job dissatisfaction, and
commuting distance. This insight will enable them to implement targeted support measures
aimed at enhancing employee retention and safeguarding our valuable workforce.
In this report, we summarize the findings and insights gained from analyzing the IBM HR
Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset.
